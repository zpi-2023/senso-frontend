            - Make sure you do not have any standalone Node.js installations when using nvm
            - Make sure you run the nvm installation with administrative rights 
        - Run `nvm install`
        - Run `node --version` to verify
    - **npm** `v9.8.x`
        - It should have been installed alongside Node.js
        - Run `npm --version` to verify
    - **Visual Studio Code** ([download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
        - When opening the project, you should receive a prompt to install recommended extensions
            - Manually install extensions from `.vscode/extensions.json` if you skipped this
    - **Expo** app on your smartphone ([download link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent))
2. Install project dependencies:
    - Run `npm install`
        - You should see a message verifying that husky was set up
            - If that was not the case, run `npx husky install`
3. Run the app:
    - Run `npm run start` (optionally with the `IP` environment variable to set the server address)
    - Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app
    - Wait for the app to compile

You should now be ready to go üéâ
